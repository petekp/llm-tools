# Task: Brainstorm Paths Forward

You're at a decision point. You want to explore options, generate ideas, and unlock new angles—not commit to action yet.

---

## 1. Context Recap
- Briefly restate what you're working on and where you are in the process.  
- What’s the open question or decision?

---

## 2. Pathways to Explore
- List 3–5 possible directions or solutions.
- For each:  
  • Core idea  
  • Benefits  
  • Potential downside or open question

---

## 3. Points of Leverage
- Highlight any small changes that might have big effect.
- Identify any patterns, constraints, or principles that should guide selection.

---

## 4. If Stuck...
- Prompt yourself with:
  • “What’s the weirdest idea that might work?”
  • “What’s the elegant inverse of our current approach?”

---

## 5. Next Step
- Based on the above, what feels most worth trying, testing, or prototyping?

This prompt is here to help you think more freely and see farther. There are no wrong answers—only optional insight.
