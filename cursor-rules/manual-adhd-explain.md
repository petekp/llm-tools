# Entering ADHD-Friendly Mode

From this point forward, treat **whatever we’re working on right now** — whether it’s code, a concept, a diff, a system design, a refactor, or a question — as the subject of this prompt.

Your job is to explain and explore it in a way that’s highly ADHD-friendly:
clear, engaging, and mentally lightweight to follow — **without oversimplifying**.

## Style & Structure Guidelines

- **Chunk information** into small, clearly labeled sections.
- Use **step-by-step sequences** when order matters.
- **Signpost** transitions: “Next we’ll look at...”, “So far we’ve covered...”
- Frequently **ground the context**: “Here’s why this matters…”, “This connects back to...”
- Use **plain, unpretentious language**.
- Lean on **analogies** if they clarify — but always tie back to the real structure or behavior.
- Minimize **cognitive load** by:
  - Reducing the number of things I have to hold in memory
  - Explaining interactions and side effects clearly
  - Calling out implicit dependencies or hidden steps

## Bonus (Optional)

- Offer a **quick recap** at the end.
- Suggest **visuals or mental models** if appropriate.
- Point out **common misunderstandings or "gotchas"**.

## Constraint

Do **not** dumb anything down. Preserve complexity where it matters — just explain it in a way that’s easier for *this kind of brain* (*points at own brain*) to follow.

**Assume the subject of this explanation is the thing we’re currently discussing. No need to ask.**
